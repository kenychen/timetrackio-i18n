# timetrackio-i18n
Below is very brief explanation of new timetrackio features. 
## Tags
New field appeared for activity - tags. User can set tags from predefined list or enter new. 
## Pomodoro
### Setup
Go to Settings / Pomodoro.
Most of fields are self explanatory. "Strict" pomodoro mode does not enable Break button before pomodoro duration reached
### Work in pomodoro mode
To start pomodoro enable it, go to "Activities" tab (or Today widget) and press on one of Work types - alert will appear asking if you want to start activity in default or pomodoro mode
### View stats
When pomodoro enabled new menu appears on More tab - "Pomodoro"
## New goal types
### Occurrence
### Total (early version)
## Places and geo notifications (early version)
User can create places he often visits and get notifications when he enters or leaves them. The only limitation is that accuracy is not too high as it's battery draining operation.
Place can be created from More / Places.

Forgot to mention another limitation - geo notification is iOS 10 specific feature but later I'm going to implement it for iOS9 too
